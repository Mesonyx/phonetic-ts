# phonetic-ts

Generates random, pronounceable (but gibberish) words.

A TypeScript update for TomFrost's [phonetic.js](https://github.com/TomFrost/node-phonetic) package. It has been altered to work with TS projects and no longer rely on the (now deprecated) [crypto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto) library.
